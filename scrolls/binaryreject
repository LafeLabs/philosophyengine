# Reject

We reject.  But we reject with some strategic movement.  


We do not say binary thinking is [false](scrolls/binaryfalse) or [true](scrolls/binarytrue), because we reject the very structure in which those entities exist(or don't).  We choose to take great care when deciding how to frame our thoughts and use what tools we need to do the job.

What do we do?

We choose our intention in the real world outside of abstract language first, then only choose to create the abstractions which will help realize our desires in the material world.

Our desire is to have all things be free for all people and built from trash. To do this, we focus on geometric constructions of objects from trash, and network connections by which people exchange information about those constructions.  This always puts geometry and network structure(topology) above numbers, algebra, and logic.  

We build our own theory of self-replicating sets which are described in [SET MAGIC](scrolls/setmagic)
