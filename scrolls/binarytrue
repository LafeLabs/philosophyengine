# Binary: It's fine

Surely, you say, the Universe is made of information. And information can be encoded in binary.  So the Universe is made of binary.  And Truth is Universal. 

But of course you know there are Dragons here.  Because quantum information science breaks the simple binary, and because universal truth machines run into paradoxes if you try to build closed systems around them.  

These Dragons are harbingers of dangers of failed models. 

But are they really falsehoods?  Surely perhaps our application of falsehood is using a function which the Dragons warn us we can never build, no?

So where does that leave us? 

We glance furtively at our Goedel as we forge ahead with the Quantum Church Turing hypotheses as we keep trying to turn the world into numbers.  

All of which is fine, because we can make a billion dollars selling our quantum computer to investors.  

Or can we?

Will quantum computers ever work?
