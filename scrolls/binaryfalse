# Binary: none of that

No binary! It is false! That is fine.

But what does that mean?

Is it fine?

If we abandon this tool, we loose not only our common dichotomies like up/down, hot/cold but all our structures of branched selection as well.  All the things we build up from binary become lost and we live in a fuzzy world of goo.  

Is this really where we want to be? Maybe.  Maybe it's worth it. Numbers have cause so much suffering perhaps it is time to just relax and watch the shapes...
