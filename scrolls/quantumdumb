You are correct.  Computers are a bad metaphor for a machine which has transformed the human condition *entirely* with communication but has been hijacked by a bunch of power mad number worshipers.  

The quantum computer is a bad idea, because computers are a bad idea.  If you want a machine with bits and bytes in which the binary arithmetic you learn in school is useless and irrellevent, just look at modern social media.  Building an actual computer which tries to break classical paradigms with wave functions of Cooper pairs is like painting a smiley face on your computer and calling it AI, only at least that is cute.  

Quantum computers are not cute, they're not funny, they're not cool, they're not useful, they're just a speculative bubble driven by a delusional priesthood who plans to drive around and make PowerPoint until everything on Earth dies.

The end.  And we lived happily ever after.
